## ExCo's History
# Early History
It appears that the framing of what the Experimental College could and would be, was both exaggerated and understated in the years leading up to its formation. As part of the “educational earthquake” of reforms in the 1960s, proponents of the new Experimental College program emphasized that open courses could be used as testing grounds in both course content and pedagogical technique. To gain approval from faculty governance and administrative structures in the College of Arts & Sciences, members of the first ExCo Committee declared that ExCo was “an educational, not a political experience”. Due to the radical nature of the program, it is unclear if these public statements were made as a political decision to maximize the chances of the program charter being approved. Opponents of the development of the Experimental College foresaw failure due to a perceived lack of expertise among students and insufficient time for students to participate in teaching and taking ExCo courses. Twenty years after its founding, an auditor from Tufts University declared that “what works well for one school does not necessarily work equally well for others”, attributing the rapid growth of and sustained participation in the ExCo Program as something unique to the ethos of the student population at Oberlin. 
ExCo experienced rapid growth in the number of courses offered and the number of students enrolled in the first few decades following its founding. The ExCo Committee intends to review and digitize all course catalogs in its history in the 2019-20 academic year, but according to an EPPC review background information document provided by the ExCo Committee, by the mid ‘80s -- two decades after its founding -- ExCo offered 50+ courses each semester, which is in the same size class as ExCo today. 
In the early years of ExCo’s existence, the program’s powers to meet demand was extremely limited. To begin, ExCo was only granted the power to offer five courses, with enrollment capped at 12 students per course. Additionally, each student could only have one ExCo course could count towards graduation, regardless of how many credits it was offered for. In response, the following year, EPPC expanded the credit allocation powers of the ExCo Committee to a max of 180 credits per semester and removed the limits for how many courses a student could receive credit. In the 1970-71 academic year, the 180 hour limit was lifted, and students instead had a three credit hour cap for ExCo credit that would count towards graduation. In 1972, the number of ExCo credits that could count towards graduation was increased to five, allowing students to justify taking more ExCo courses during their time at Oberlin.
