## ExCo's History
# Early History: 
I appears that the framing of what the Experimental College could and would be, was both exaggerated and understated in the years leading up to its formation. As part of the “educational earthquake” of reforms in the 1960s, proponents of the new Experimental College program emphasized that open courses could be used as testing grounds in both course content and pedagogical technique. 

To gain approval from faculty governance and administrative structures in the College of Arts & Sciences, members of the first ExCo Committee declared that ExCo was “an educational, not a political experience”. Due to the radical nature of the program, it is unclear if these public statements were made as a political decision to maximize the chances of the program charter being approved. 

Opponents of the development of the Experimental College foresaw failure due to a perceived lack of expertise among students and insufficient time for students to participate in teaching and taking ExCo courses. 

ExCo experienced rapid growth in the number of courses offered and the number of students enrolled in the first few decades following its founding. According to a background information document provided by the ExCo Committee for EPPC review, by the mid ‘80s -- two decades after its founding -- ExCo offered 50+ courses each semester, which is in the same size class as ExCo today. 

In 1987, Robyn Gittleman from Tufts University declared that “what works well for one school does not necessarily work equally well for others”, attributing the rapid growth of and sustained participation in the ExCo Program as something unique to the ethos of the student population at Oberlin. 

By 1977, the ExCo Committee was becoming aware that the theoretical purpose of ExCo was not being met, and in practice, many students viewed ExCo as a means to get easy credit. To counter this, ExCo makes an effort to redefine the purpose of ExCo as well as create more stringent guidelines so that they could distance themselves from the past of: “practically every course that was proposed was accepted”.

# Experimental Course Content in ExCo:
While more research needs to be done, there are plenty of examples of outside organizations allocating funds for the development of an ExCo Course that wouldn’t be accepted in the traditional Oberlin curriculum. The semester before ExCo offered its first class, the International Affairs Committees announced a $250 grant to develop a course in international studies, suggesting broad excitement across campus, spanning students as well as campus leaders in established organizations. In 1972, the Oberlin Review reported on how “Feminist Theatre, Women in Art, a women writer’s group, and Automechanics” were offered through ExCo, and in 1997 the Multicultural Resource Center created a grant to develop an ExCo oriented towards first years. As is the case today, the 1980 ExCo Committee hoped “that involvement of persons not affiliated with Oberlin College will ease some of the friction now apparent between the College and the town”. 

# The ExCo Committee:
When ExCo was first founded, in the spirit of open education and self-governance, any student at Oberlin College could participate on the ExCo Committee. The ExCo Committee was “ad hoc”, and all committee meetings open to the public. While there were no limits to how many students could be on the Committee, it typically hovered around the size of the committee today -- 5 student members. 

The culture of the ExCo Committee has seemingly remained constant throughout its entire existence and is well-characterized by this quote from the 1973 Review article: “We ExCo people usually keep our mouths shut. We work quietly behind the scenes, setting up registration, coordinating the courses, allocating monies, and generally being too occupied to become embroiled in campus politics.” 

Due to a lack of campus visibility, the ExCo Committee could fluctuate rapidly between healthy participation and severely lacking person power in a single semester. This is similar to problems faced by other student organizations on campus including OSCA, SFC, OST, etc. In a single semester, all but a few experienced committee members could graduate, leaving the remaining members with the responsibility of both maintaining the department as well as on-boarding new committee members. 

In a 1987 academic review, Robyn Gittleman commented on the lack of student investment in the behind-the-scenes operations of the ExCo Committee: “because of the belief in autonomy and absolute student control, an ambiguous and somewhat schizophrenic state exists.”

This “schizophrenic state” due to necessary turnover in committee participation is what restricted the necessary “self-reflection” of a department that had truly come to maturity. “Although they had thought about the ExCo mandate and history, the Committee never felt obligated or had the time to reflect on the broader meaning of an Oberlin education or their relationship to the total undergraduate education. The great variance of subject matter and the awarding of credit seemed not to be an issue, but rather something they took for granted”

# Credit-Allocation Powers of the ExCo Committee:
In the early years of ExCo’s existence, the program’s powers to meet demand was extremely limited. To begin, ExCo was only granted the power to offer five courses, with enrollment capped at 12 students per course. Additionally, each student could only have one ExCo course count towards graduation, regardless of how many credits it was offered for. In response, the following year, EPPC expanded the credit allocation powers of the ExCo Committee to a max of 180 credits per semester and removed the limits for how many courses a student could receive credit. In the 1970-71 academic year, the 180 hour limit was lifted, and students instead had a three credit hour cap for ExCo credit that would count towards graduation. In 1972, the number of ExCo credits that could count towards graduation was increased to five, allowing students to justify taking more ExCo courses during their time at Oberlin.  In 1980, in response to increasing instructor frustration with credit restrictions, the ExCo Committee made a request to further expand its credit-allocating powers, however this request was denied by faculty governance.

# Parting Thoughts:
While ExCo has consistently lacked a sense of belonging among the rest of the curricular structure of Oberlin, it has a substantial impact on the educational experience of nearly any person who chooses to participate as either an instructor, student, or member of the ExCo Committee. It is both surprising and unique to observe that Oberlin’s Experimental College has persisted for over half a century, while similar ventures at other schools typically disappear within a decade. ExCo’s existence requires both continued investment from the student body as well as a perceived value in the eyes of faculty governance structures. While I agree that ExCo achieved “maturity” in the 1980’s, there is still plenty to be done to create a more robust ExCo program that is better able to supplement the rest of an Oberlin Education. Many of the problems mentioned in the 1987 EPPC Report -- especially those brought to attention by Robyn Gittleman -- are still being considered by the ExCo Committee to this day. 

It seems like several changes have come in the past decade to address some of these problems such as: the transition of the ExCo Committee from being ad hoc and without pay to a closed committee with pay, the digitization of course applications and workflow processes internal to the ExCo Committee, and the creation of the ExCo Showcase. 

I believe that each of these have been major steps forward, and I commend current and past members of the ExCo Committee for all they have done for the Experimental College. 

There are a few major points for improvement that I believe future Committee members as well as general ExCo participants can work on in the coming years. 
- Further improving continuity between iterations of the ExCo Committee through the formation of ad hoc advisory councils (one of instructors/students and one of faculty/administrators).
- Further freeing up ExCo Committee time to focus on the improvement of the program through the automation of tedious processes relating to the day-to-day operations of ExCo.
- Maximizing the value of coordinating an ExCo Course by experimenting with the balance between instructor assignments aiming for pedagogical growth and instructor autonomy. 
- Improving student investment in the governance and operational structures behind ExCo through increased publicity of the ExCo Committee and their activities.
