# OberlinExCo.github.io
A Website for Oberlin ExCo

# Author
Initialized by Lars Dreith, Oberlin College '20

Maintained and updated by Alex Jensen, Oberlin College '21

# Includes Directory
Contains elements that occur on every page, such as the header, footer, navigation, and social links, as well as some other elements that have been separated out for ease of use. This is the directory that you will access if you want to update the current and previous committee members, as well as add webpages to the navigation bar.

# Layouts Directory
Allows us to specify formats for the different pages in the website. We use the home layout for the homepage, the announcement layout any time we want a header with the word "announcements," and the default otherwise. See some of the webpages to see how this is used.

# Site Directory
Outdated directory. Not necessary to touch this.

# Image Directory
If you want to add any images to the website, add them here and then access them using /img/yourimage.jpg. This allows us to keep all of our images in one place.

# Assets Directory
Contains all of the stylizing files for the entire website. If you want to change something specific, such as every link color, it will most likely be in assets/css/style.css.

# Resources and About Directories
This is how we group together webpages that will appear in the same tab in the navigation bar. For example, if you want to add a page that you can access via the Resources tab, you should put it in the resources folder and then link it in the navigation from the includes directory, mentioned above.

Add old Course Catalogs to the oldcourses page, and if you notice any new blogs about ExCo, feel free to link them in the readmore page.

# Apply Directory
This must be updated regularly, both to tell potential instructors when they need to apply or if the application season is currently not open. There is also now a page for great syllabi so potentiaal instructors can have an idea on what is expected.

# Index
Use this to keep up announcements on the homepage.
