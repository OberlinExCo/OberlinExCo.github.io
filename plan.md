#### For 3rd Years:
<p style="text-align: left">Students who will not be on campus in the Fall can either choose to teach their class remotely, delay their acceptance to a future semester, or pass instructorship to another individual who will be on campus. Students who are not on campus will not be able to receive credit for teaching or taking an ExCo.</p>
