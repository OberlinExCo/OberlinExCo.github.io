## Apply to Teach

We are currently accepting applications to teach an ExCo. Course applications close October 31st.

We will be holding an ExCo application workshop on Saturday, October 24th.

<p style="text-align: left">All courses, new and old, need to complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyDx5Z2q28wuGS18sw-CO5WDEZrINhOQtjtcO4Irs6Ycwt_Q/viewform">course application.</a> All new instructors and all returning instructors teaching a different course must also individually complete an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXCkhFx1NgFxU6I0pJJPVD8JtLLIzY8o1I2DsMiFLqhZIJNw/viewform">instructor application.</a> If you are entirely new to the ExCo program as an instructor, you are also required to get faculty and general recommendations to be accepted as an instructor (forward them the instructor application link so they can fill this out!)</p>

<p style="text-align: left">If you are confused about what forms to fill out, more information is provided in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFS0LtDDnevyFKj53QWFwt-B-IWEndoCHSakCSTr4m8/edit">application document.</a> You are also welcome to come into office hours to talk with an ExCo Committee member about your specific situation. Our office hours are listed at our <a href="/index.html">home page.</a></p>
