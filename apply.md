## Apply to Teach

Apply to teach an ExCo for the Fall 2020 semester! 

<p style="text-align: left">All courses, new and old, need to complete a course application. All new instructors and all returning instructors teaching a different course must also individually complete an instructor application. If you are entirely new to the ExCo program as an instructor, you are also required to get faculty and general recommendations to be accepted as an instructor (forward them the instructor application link so they can fill this out!)</p>



<p style="text-align: left">If you are confused about what forms to fill out, more information is provided in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10j_tkMfaOE2CMQoNcNGKblLPI4JzWxcArnB7Q9AEPxg/edit?usp=sharing">document.</a> You are also welcome to come into office hours to talk with an ExCo Committee member about your specific situation. Our office hours are listed at our <a href="/index.html">home page.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">Everything will be due on May 1st, 2020 at 11:59pm. Note that the forms will no longer allow submissions after this time. Applications submitted before April 17th will receive priority during our application process.</p>
