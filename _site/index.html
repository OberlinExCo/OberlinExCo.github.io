<p>Oberlin ExCo is a 50 year-old organization that offers courses taken by over a thousand unique students each year.</p>

<p>Anyone, town or gown, can teach an ExCo, on whatever they are passionate about! When reviewing course applications, the ExCo Committee is subject-agnostic and solely considers applications based on the instructor’s commitment to the course, familiarity with the subject matter, and depth of thought when making the syllabus.</p>

<p>Courses can be taken or taught for credit, but we are unfortunately unable to financially compensate non-students for teaching courses through ExCo at this time. Up to eight co-curricular credits can be counted towards general credit requirements, but ExCo courses cannot officially count towards divisional requirements. ExCo courses can be offered for either one or two credits.</p>

<p>Typically, courses meet once or twice a week in a regular location. To learn about what courses are being taught, check out our course catalog or attend the ExCo Fair the first Wednesday of each semester.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about ExCo or talk about an idea for your course, feel free to visit one of our committee members during office hours, listed below.</p>
