### Other Info
<p style="text-align: left">Please note that you will still have to read our emails! While the vast majority of our communication will come from the exco@oberlin.edu account, we always send the Students Surveys from the excoevals@gmail.com email, which allows us to edit the Google Script to generate surveys for each course.</p>
