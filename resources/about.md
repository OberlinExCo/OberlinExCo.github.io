## About ExCo

<p style="text-align: left">Anyone, town or gown, can teach an ExCo on whatever they are passionate about! When reviewing course applications, the ExCo Committee is subject-agnostic and solely considers applications based on the instructor’s commitment to the course, familiarity with the subject matter, and depth of thought when making the syllabus. <a href="/resources/history.html">Read about ExCo's history here</a>, or <a href="/resources/readmore.html">read some blogs about ExCo here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Courses can be taken or taught for credit, but we are unfortunately unable to financially compensate non-students for teaching courses through ExCo at this time. Up to eight co-curricular credits can be counted towards general credit requirements, but ExCo courses cannot officially count towards divisional requirements. ExCo courses can be offered for either one or two credits.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Typically, courses meet once or twice a week in a regular location. To learn about what courses are being taught, check out our course catalog or attend the ExCo Fair the first Wednesday of each semester. <a href="/resources/oldcourses.html">View past course offerings here.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">If you’d like to learn more about ExCo or talk about an idea for your course, feel free to visit one of our committee members during office hours.</p>
